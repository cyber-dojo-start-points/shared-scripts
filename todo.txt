DONE. Write script to get all CDL dir-names into a bash array.

DONE. See if CDL dir-name is always the same as repo-name. It is.

Can now run script and create all CDSP repos.
  Then I can update languages-start-points repo to use URLs based on CDSP rather than CDL
  Then I can delete all start_point/ dirs from CDL repos.


Write different? script to explicitly tag image_name in manifest.json with latest tag?
  Use image_manifest_tagger (Ruby + JSON.pretty_generate)
  But make parsing of image_name more sophisticated?
    Do any of the not-yet-done CDL repos have image_name with a tag? NO.

Write script to remove max_seconds from manifest.json?
